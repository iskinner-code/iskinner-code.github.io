      <section>

          <h3>Intel</h3>
        </a>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Contrast: Everthing on the site constrats well with one another, the
            colors mix well and don't clash. The text is easil readable due to
            the color.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repetition: Font styles and color schemes are consistant, maybe
            changing which color is applied in the background but using the same
            colors for the sites page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alignment: Text and images are aligned to fit each section of the
            site very well and allow for great transitions. It makes the site
            easily readable and easily traversable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity: Everything is grouped together very well, such as new
            products and what they can do, then news about the company, and
            finally additional information such as downloads and company
            details.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Pacific Northweast X-Ray Inc.</h3>
        </a>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Contrast: While parts of the site are easy to read, some parts have
            lighter/neon colors which clash with the background, making it to
            read or look at. Some images are different sizes than others, either
            too big or too small
          </li>
          <li>
            Repetition: Font size tend to remain the same, however some parts of
            the website will have different colors and switch from green, to
            yellow, and then to black.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alignment: Sometimes the text and images are not aligned properly.
            In parts of the website, there will be an image right after some
            text, causing a wide gap in the page. Also, text will be misaligned
            due to where an image is placed, causing the text to look cluttery
            at points.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity: In places proximity seems good and everything seems
            somewhat organized, in other places however, it can feel very packed
            or jammed together. Besides that proximity is good.
